    question: "Do I need to know anything about AI or automation?",
    answer:
      "No. That\u2019s our job. You know your business \u2014 we handle the technical side entirely. We\u2019ll explain everything in plain language and make sure your team can actually use what we build.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from Zapier or Make.com?",
    answer:
      "Zapier and Make run rule-based workflows: \u201Cif this, then that.\u201D That\u2019s useful for simple tasks. An agentic OS uses AI to make decisions, handle edge cases, draft content, interpret context, and improve over time. It\u2019s the difference between a flowchart and a smart employee.",
  },
  {
    question: "What tools and platforms do you work with?",
    answer:
      "We\u2019re tool-agnostic. We commonly work with HubSpot, Salesforce, Notion, Airtable, Slack, Gmail, Google Workspace, QuickBooks, Stripe, Shopify, and more. We build with a mix of custom AI agents, Make.com/n8n for orchestration, and OpenAI/Anthropic models under the hood.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a project take?",
    answer:
      "The free audit is a 30-minute call. If we move forward, the Discovery phase takes 1\u20132 weeks. The Build Sprint takes 4\u20138 weeks depending on scope. Most clients are live with a working agentic OS within 8\u201310 weeks of first contact.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does it cost?",
    answer:
      "The audit is free. Discovery is $2,500\u2013$5,000. Build Sprints are $8,000\u2013$25,000 depending on scope. Ongoing retainers are $1,500\u2013$4,000/month. Most clients see full ROI within 3 months.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my team actually use it?",
    answer:
      "This is the #1 concern we hear. Our process specifically includes buy-in work and training \u2014 not just \u201Chere\u2019s your system, good luck.\u201D We build adoption into the process, not as an afterthought.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I own the system you build?",
    answer:
      "Yes. 100%. You own the code, the workflows, the prompts, and the integrations. If you ever want to take it in-house or work with someone else, you can. No lock-in.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if something breaks after you deploy?",
    answer:
      "Retainer clients get proactive monitoring and fixes included. Non-retainer clients get a 30-day support window post-launch. After that, we offer support packages or a retainer upgrade.",
